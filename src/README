rsyslog - what's it?
====================

rsyslog is a high-performance, modular system event processor. While it started
as a regular syslogd, it has evolved into a kind of swiss army knife of logging,
being able to accept inputs from a wide variety of sources, transform them, and
output to the results to diverse destinations.

Rsyslog can deliver over one million messages (V7, December 2013) to local
destinations when limited processing is applied. Even with remote destinations
and more elaborate processing the performance is usually considered "stunning".

Project Philosophy
==================
We are an open source project in all aspects and very open to outside feedback
and contribution. We base our work on standards and try to solve all real-world
needs (of course, we occasionally fail tackeling actually all needs ;)). While
the project is primarily sponsored by Adiscon, technical development is 
independent from company goals and most decisions are solely based on mailing
list discussion results. There is an active commuity around rsyslog.

There is no such thing like being an official member of the rsyslog team. The
closest to that is being subscribed to the mailing list:
    http://lists.adiscon.net/mailman/listinfo/rsyslog

This method of open discussions is modelled after the IETF process, which is
probably the best-known and most successive collaborative standards body.

Project Funding
===============
Rsyslog's main sponsor Adiscon tries to fund rsyslog by selling custom
development and support contracts. Adiscon does NOT license rsyslog under a
commercial license (this is simply impossible for anyone due to rsyslog's
license structure).

Any third party is obviously also free to offer custom development, support
and rsyslog consulting. We gladly merge result of such third-party work into
the main repository (assuming it matches the few essential things written
down in our contribution policy).

Contributions
=============
Contributions to rsyslog are very welcome. To learn more about how
to contribute, please visit
    http://www.rsyslog.com/how-to-contribute-to-rsyslog/

Note that the rsyslog team usually has a very long todo list. Help
with that list is much appreicated.

Documentation
=============
The main rsyslog documenation is available in html format. To read
it, point your web browser to ./doc/manual.html. Alternatively,
you can view the documentation for *the most recent rsyslog version*
online at
    http://www.rsyslog.com/doc

Development Model
=================
Rsyslog uses the integration manager workflow as described here:
